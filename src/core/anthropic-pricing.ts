/**
 * Anthropic chat pricing — a bare-keyed VIEW of the canonical pricing table
 * (`src/core/model-pricing.ts`).
 *
 * Kept as a distinct export because many callers look up by bare Claude id
 * (`claude-opus-4-7`) and because `estimateMaxCostUsd` carries the
 * null-on-miss contract the dream-cycle budget gate depends on. The dollar
 * numbers live in model-pricing.ts — DO NOT hand-edit prices here; this map is
 * derived from the `anthropic:` canonical entries (prefix stripped), so it
 * cannot drift from the other pricing views. (Pre-unification this map and
 * takes-quality-eval/pricing.ts duplicated the numbers and drifted: Opus 4.7
 * read $15/$75 in one and $5/$25 in the other.)
 *
 * Codex P1 #10 fold: `estimateMaxCostUsd` keeps its null-on-miss contract, and
 * a null estimate makes the dream-cycle budget gate wave the submit through.
 * BudgetMeter therefore prices through `canonicalLookup` first and only falls
 * back here, so a model is unbounded ONLY when the canonical table has no
 * rates for it either — that case still warns `BUDGET_METER_NO_PRICING` once
 * per process.

/**
 * Resolve a chat model id to its canonical pricing entry.
 *
 * Looks at the FULL canonical table, not just the bare-keyed Anthropic view.
 * Previously this resolved against `ANTHROPIC_PRICING` alone, which is
 * `CANONICAL_PRICING` filtered to `anthropic:` keys — so every non-Anthropic
 * model priced a `null` even though canonical carried its rate (14 of the 25
 * canonical entries were unreachable). Because `BudgetTracker.reserve()`
 * hard-throws `BudgetExhausted{reason:'no_pricing'}` when a cap is set and
 * pricing is missing, that made every cost-capped path — `gbrain enrich`,
 * `cycle.enrich_thin`, `extract_atoms`, skillopt — fail outright on OpenAI,
 * Gemini, and DeepSeek models. See garrytan/gbrain#2504.
 *
 * Resolution order, most-specific first:
 *   1. bare Anthropic id (`claude-haiku-4-5`) — the form most callers pass
 *   2. fully-qualified canonical id (`openai:gpt-5.2`)
 *   3. bare id behind any provider prefix (`bedrock:claude-haiku-4-5`)
 *
 * Routing-provider ids (`openrouter:openai/gpt-5.2`) deliberately stay
 * unpriced. A router bills its OWN rates, so resolving it to the vendor's
 * direct price would under-estimate real spend — a silently wrong cap is worse
 * than a refused one under the TX2 contract. Pricing routers needs their rate
 * table, which is out of scope here (existing TODO #2, pinned by the
 * "OpenRouter nested form returns null" test).
